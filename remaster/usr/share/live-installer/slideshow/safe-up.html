<div class="content"><ul>
<p>Remaster uses update packs.<br>
With these update packs we increase stability and security by testing the incoming packages before they are released.</p>
<li>The security repository is synchronized daily.</li>
<li>On the first of each month, the repositories are synchronized and tested.</li>
<li>The release of an update pack will be postponed until the next month when critical breakages cannot be solved.</li>
<li>Status updates are communicated by blog, RSS feed, our forum, Facebook and Twitter.</li>

<li>You can find a complete description of the update pack process on the Remaster forum.</li>
